Nowadays we all have high tech computational devices. We all have a reasonable computational power in our PCs.
Mostly we use 30 to 40% of it for our daily uses. Rest of the power remains unused although the expense of electricity is same.
I am starting a task for you. I will lend some computational power of your device with your permission.
Remember it is just an experiment task so I cannot promise any dividends.
If my work result in success you will get your piece INSHALLAH!
Now you are thinking about that what should you have to do?
In simple words you do not have to do anything hard at all…
How is it possible that I lend your computational power?
Yes, It is; if you do not believe, try it…
Why am I offering you to join?
Because drops can make Oceans. Our small devices can do it altogether what a so called giant PC can do.

& many more questions……
I request to hold all these questions for a while and take a try with me!!
Moreover, you just have to open the tool that will be provided and supported by me for the whole life of this project.
All the technical support will be given. It is a portable tool. You can place it in your pen drive or in any directory.
It will never mess with your system files.

Let us join and mine together
